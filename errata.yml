        erratum: "Closure lemma needs typing assumption |- e : X"
        comment: >
          To prove e \in Halt_X, we need |- e : X (see erratum for slide 9). When
          proving the closure lemma, we will assume e' \in Halt_X and try and prove
          e \in Halt_X, so we need to show |- e : X. But "reverse preservation" is not
          a theorem, so this fails. However, if we assume |- e : X up front, then the
          proof is straightforward.
